## Overview

Hello everyone. This is my Blog Preview Card. This tricky little project tested my current understanding of HTML and CSS, however i persevered and even learned a few new things in the process. Overall I am happy with the final result.

## My process

I workflow consisted of switching back and forth between HTML and CSS to complete this project so I could grasp an isea of the finished piece. Then lastly I included the hover pseudo state.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to target a child of a parent div so that when a pseudo class is activated for the parent, the child's property/properties change.

### Continued development

This was a test of my current coding knowledge. I shall continue to expand my skill set from here.
